# BoincTasks
This repository contains bash scripts and python code that sends temperature
information to BoincTasks.

The folder SystemdService has an install script that creats a sevicce to run
the program on boot-up or by using
 "sudo systemctl start boinctasks_temps" etc

Before installing the service you should run the scripts in the "NonService" 
folder to verify you have all the required files.

There are readme's in each folder.

Suggest you create a "temp" folder and download the entire "zip" into it.

Any problem email me:  josephy@stateson.net or create an "issue"
